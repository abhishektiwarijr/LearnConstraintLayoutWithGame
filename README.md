## Mastering Constraint Layout

This is a demo application that is used in conjunction with my "Mastering Android Layouts" workshop.

The purpose of this layout is to showcase how to use ConstraintLayout to solve a complex layout.

The app has no functionality but to display a layout. 
This was presented with these slides https://speakerdeck.com/riggaroo/mastering-android-layouts-workshop-slides
